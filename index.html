        <p> Something exciting happened a few weeks ago. My first two flowers grew on my tomato plant! I have been <em>waiting</em>   for some thing to happen. Hopefully, they will be pollinated by polinators and grow into tomatoes. I don't like tomatoes though, <strong>unless </STRONG>their with other foods. Right now, I'm waiting for my bean plant to grow since it's still little. By the way, as you might think, I like growing vegetables. I would like to get fruits on my backyard but our house isn't bought... it's shared. That means my parents have to pay for it as long as we live there. My mom says though that we might get a new house sometime though!

        I think you should do HTML and CSS. These two are used for making a website. HTML is for making the website while CSS is used for making the website stylish. You can learn a lot about HTML and CSS very quickly on <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan academy</a>. Khan academy isn't just for HTML and CSS though, it is also for other subjects. The subjects I'm taking are currently:HTMl/CSS, math, and reading. There are much more subjects though. just click " courses" on the top left corner and it will show all the subjects there are.

Hello! I'm about to take the cognitive test next week. I've been preparing with a series from <a href="https://mercerpublishing.com/">Mercer Publishing</a>. There, there are books to prepare for the cognitive test. The cognitive test is only for the <a href="https://www.pylusd.org/">PYLUSD</a> district as far as I know.

    I know I haven't texted in a while. There are lots of things I want to show you! First, on my tomato plant that I said had flower,  grew! Now one of the flowers grew into tomatoes! It's still small though. It's green so it still has to grow more.The other was that My friend Jackson had to leave to go online because of COVID-19. Not because he had it though, it was more because of just the thing. Anyways, have you ever heard of <a href="https://www.magellantv.com/">Magellan T.V? </a> It's kind of like ,<a href="https://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a>. It has all kinds of movies although I only watch thngs like these: <a href="https://www.magellantv.com/video/einstein-and-the-theory-of-relativity">(Click on Me)</a>. I have to go now, Bye!

    Hi, today was a great day. At school today, I told my friend Matthew I would wait for him at recess time because he needed to do something, but he never came! Well, he did come, but my P.E teacher, Mr.A had already started his end - of recess P.E class that he <em><strong>sometimes</strong></em> does. I also want to show you something else, have you ever heard of <a href = "https://aopsacademy.org/" >AoPS academy</a>? It's basically a website where they give you challenging math I'll start my online classes in January. I like it because it's a challengeüòÅ. I have to go now, bye!

 Hi,sorry I haven't written. I can tell you about a lot of things now though! Cristmas Day and Eve were both fun. My cousins (Blanca and Alejandro)and their parents came over. Alejandro is 2 years old and the problem with him is that every single time I come over to play my piano, he comes and tries to push me off the piano and, if I don't move he starts playing with the volume! But it was still funüòÄ. 2 days till New Years Eve! This is it for today. Bye!
